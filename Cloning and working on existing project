1. Git init in the new direcotry you created
2. Git clone expalepath
3. Then cd into the folder that was created during the clone
4. Then run npm install
5. ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only --from=1.7.4
This removed .angular-cli.json and created angular.json.

If this leads to your project using 1.7.4, install v6 locally:

npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@v6.0.0-rc.4
And try once again to update your project with:

ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only --from=1.7.4
