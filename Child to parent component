1. We have a header compoenent that is a child directory of app.component so an action that is executed in the child component will
end up affecting the parent component, in this case the child component is the header and when a specific link is clicked, the parent 
comnpoenet ie "app.component" will react.

2. Below is the code of the child component template


// We use a Angular click function and nest a method onSelect within it if the recipe link is selected, recipe variable will be passed to
the onSelect method, and the shopping list linke will work the same way.
<li><a href="#" (click)="onSelect('recipe')">Recipeps</a></li>
<li><a href="#" (click)="onSelect('shopping-list')">Shoppping List</a></li>


3. Below is the child component ts file "header.ts" 

import { Component, OnInit, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})
export class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {
  // using @Output will allow us to share the below EventEmitter with the parent compoenent. 
  @Output() featureSelected = new EventEmitter<string>();
  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit() {
  }
  // Using the onSelect method we used in the template above, we accept the string value passed and assign it as a value to 
  the emmiter featureSelected
  onSelect(e: string) {
    this.featureSelected.emit(e);
  }
}

4. Below we are in our parent component 
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'appone';
  // Here we declare a variable and set it to recipe 
  loadedFeature = 'recipe';
  // onNavigate is a method that was created only to pass in the value of loaded feature
  onNavigate(e: string) {
    this.loadedFeature = e;
  }
}

5. Below is the parent component template
<app-recipes *ngIf="loadedFeature === 'recipe'"> </app-recipes>
<app-shopping-list *ngIf="loadedFeature != 'recipe'"> </app-shopping-list>
