1. in models and in the Users model we add a bollean called hide and set it to true

2. in the ts file we add the hide property to the people we have hard coded in this ts file, then go to line 52
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
   
      this.users = [
        {
          firstName: 'John',
          lastName: 'Doe',
          age: 70,
          address: {
            street: '50 Main st',
            city: 'Boston',
            state: 'MA'
          },
          hide: true
    
        },
        {
          firstName: 'Kevin',
          lastName: 'Johnson',
          age: 34,
          address: {
            street: '20 School st',
            city: 'Lynn',
            state: 'MA'
          },
            hide: true
        },
        {
          firstName: 'Karen',
          lastName: 'Williams',
          age: 26,
          address: {
            street: '55 Mill st',
            city: 'Miami',
            state: 'FL'
          },
          hide: true
   
        }
      ];

      this.loaded = true;
  }

  addUser(user: User) {
    this.users.push(user);
  }
  //when the button is pushed we take a value of User and set user.hide to user not hide, if we set the boolean to false 
  //we would not be able to toggle it shut.
  toggleHide(user: User){
   user.hide = !user.hide;
  }
  
 3.html file, notice how the param is the exact same as in the ts file above
 <button class="btn btn-xs" (click)="toggleHide(user)">toggle</button>
 
 4. this could also be completed like this, eliminating the ts file
  <button class="btn btn-xs" (click)="user.hide = !user.hide">toggle</button>
