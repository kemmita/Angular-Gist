1. After you have created a compoenet, you will see a number of files that were generated.
2. The only ones we will concern ourselves with our the .html, .css, and .ts files
3. Html and css files are self explanitory.
4. The ts file below is the basics we need in order to use a component.

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  // The selector is the html tag that will be used to call on this componenet in the app.component.html file
  selector: 'app-server',
  templateUrl: './server.component.html'
})
export class ServerComponent {

}


5. As of right now the selector declared above is being used in the src/app/app.component file.

<app-server></app-server>
 

6. Always verify that your component has been registered in the /src/app/app.modules.ts file, or it will not work.

import { ServerComponent } from './server/server.component';

 declarations: [
    ServerComponent
  ],

7. The compoenet folder should be placed within the src/app directory
