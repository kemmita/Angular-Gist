1. Inside of the component templat, us the event binding method (click) to call on a method that was created in the components ts file.

<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>

2. In the ts file we can see the method and how the variable is being changed when the method is called

export class ServerComponent implements OnInit {
  serverCreationStatus:string = 'No server was created!';
  onCreateServer() {
    this.serverCreationStatus = 'Server was created.';
  }
}
