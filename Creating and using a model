1. Name the file and place it within its respective component folder. For this example, we will be placing it in the recpie directory
and naming the file recpie.model.ts. Below is the code for the model.

//Models in angular are just like models in .NET, a class we use with properties to create a structured object.
// If we wish to utuilize the model we must export it. 
export class Recipe {
   public name: string;
   public description: string;
   public imagePath: string;

   constructor(name: string, description: string, imagePath: string) {
       this.name = name;
       this.description = description;
       this.imagePath = imagePath;
   }
}

2. to use the class/model we will need to first import it, we do not use dependency injection like we do in .NET
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import {Recipe} from '../recipe.model';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-recipe-list',
  templateUrl: './recipe-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./recipe-list.component.css']
})
export class RecipeListComponent implements OnInit {
  recipes: Recipe[] = [
      new Recipe('Cheese', 'This is made from cheese', 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/2294361/'),
  ];

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
