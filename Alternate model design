1. This code below will keep us from having to write out the normal model code.

export class Ingredient {
constructor(public name: string, amount: number) {}
}


2. Below is a typical model design the above code does the same thing.

export class Ingredient {
public name: string;
public amount: number;

constructor(name: string, amount: number) {
  this.name = name;
  this.amount = amount;
}
}
